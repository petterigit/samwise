# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Task Description

Familiarize yourself with API documentation at https://ringsdb.com and create a React app in
which:

- the user can fetch decks from the API one at a time with the deck's id,
- after fetching the deck, present all hero cards from the deck,
- when user clicks on a card, the user can see the detailed information on the card,
- in the detailed informations, a modernized version for the card is displayed (a Card
  element), that should have the values of the card displayed similarly to the picture of the
  card

Use TypeScript for coding. You can use other libraries you'd prefer and styling can also be done by your preference. We hope that you try to show us your quality standards in the submission.
